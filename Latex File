\section{introduction}}

In neuronal and cardiac tissues,momentary impulses of the membrane
of potential are called action potentials and are found to be caused
by electric currents of an ionic nature, which flow through the
channels of the cells of such membranes. The cellular currents taken into
examined, are divided into two different types, according to their
ionic composition:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.
\item
  The `fast' current (fast-response excitatory variable \(u\)) increases
  as membrane conductance increases, by the ions
  positive ions of Na and Ca. Ergo,such positive ions increase
  the intensity of the current and therefore depotentiate the difference in the
  membrane potential (which we assume to be negative).It is precisely such
  current that causes action potentials,that is,neuronal impulses
  or cardiac impulses.
\item
  The `slow' current ( Slow-response inhibotory variable \(v\))is
  caused by the delayed response of the channels of \(K^{-\),\ which
  allow these negative ions to leave the cell, causing
  thus the recovery phase.Physically,such ion pumps act as
  batteries to maintain ion concentration gradients between the
  cells.
\end{enumerate}

From a purely mathematical-computational treatment,the equations, and the
its parameters, that are suitable to describe a system of two
variables for neuronal and cardiac membrane excitation, are the
Fitzhugh--Nagumo equations:

\[\frac{du}{dt}=u(u - a)(1 - u)-v + s(t)\] \((0.0)\)

\[\frac{dv}{dt} =e(u-bv)\] \((0.1)\)

With the following parameters chosen: \(a=0.15,b=2.5\), \(e=0.01\) (this
parameter must be small to represent the slow response
inhibitory), \(s(t)= 0.01-0.06\) (variable source term that
within that range simulates a self-stimulated impulse).

From the biological phenomenon concerning membrane excitations
neurons and heart, parallels can be established with circuits
electronics.

In fact, the objective of this paper will be to describe in sections 0.2 and 0.3, the excitation of membranes and then derive the
cardiac/neuronal action potentials, by means of two circuit models
different structurally but equivalent in description: the circuit of
Nagumo and the three-transistor circuit.

To do this, the modus operandi will be to relate the mesh laws of
such circuits to the mathematical equations of Fitzhugh-- Nagumo,
emphasizing the importance of the choice of parameters, but especially
of the initial conditions, for the stability of such a model. It is worth
note that the practical approach for the realization of the
model-circuits, although algorithmically similar, is very different and
allows highlighting different nuances related to the same thematic
biological.

In the last part of the paper, we will describe how
such cardiac/neuronal impulses propagate, with the analysis of a
unitary segment of a transmission line between two nodes at different potential
different (to continue the circuit analogy),by means of the well-known
diffusion equation.

\subsection{model stability and conditions

We get into the heart of the analysis about the stability of the F-N equations,
related to the Nagumo circuit. Before doing so, it is necessary to recall
brief theoretical definitions concerning the concept of equilibrium and
stability of a system:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The equilibrium point of the system is defined as the point of
  intersection of the trajectories (called nullclines) 
  \[ \frac{du}{dt} = 0 ; \frac{dv}{dt} = 0 \] in the phase space.
\item
  An equilibrium point is said to be stable (according to Lyapunov) if every
  orbit of the system in phase space, which starts sufficiently
  close to the equilibrium point, remains in the vicinity of the point of
  equilibrium.
\end{itemize}

The system of equations we are analyzing is a nonlinear system,
so we want to check whether it is stable as the conditions change
initial conditions. Previously we solved the system by choosing a
particular initial condition: $ t_0 = 0 $ ; $ u_0 =0.2 $;
$v_0 =0.08$, the reason for this choice is due to the fact that these
points are stability points of the system, information obtained
from the graphical intersection of the nullclines predicted by the F-N model:

\[ u \cdot (u - a) \cdot (1 - u) - v + s = 0\]
\[ e \cdot (u - b \cdot v) = 0\]

Computationally, through the intersection of these trajectors,
we obtained the coordinates of the stability point.

    \adjustimage{max size={0.6\linewidth}{0.6\paperheight}}{6.0.jpeg}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
      
    
If we try to make a variation of the initial conditions, in
a neighborhood of the equilibrium point, one obtains evidence that the
F-N. equations turn out to be very sensitive and therefore not stable
with respect to a minimal variation of the initial conditions. This is
evident in that the orbit in the phase space of $Figure 2$,
deviates from the course of the equilibrium initial condition described above ,in
reference to $Figure 1$; specifically, the trajectory is no longer
closed and moves away from the equilibrium point.

An equivalent model to the Fitzhugh-Nagumo circuit is the three
transistors shown in the figure:


\begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.4\linewidth}{0.4\paperheight}}{circuit2.jpeg}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}


The circuit can be made simpler by replacing the first two
transistors a resistor \(R_{fast}(V)\), which is a function of the voltage
\(V\) applied to the capacitor \(C\).\ This voltage represents the
excitatory variable of the senotrial node. The voltage \(V_b\) of the
base of the transistor represents the inhibitory variable.


\begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.4\linewidth}{0.4\paperheight}}{circuit3.jpeg}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}

Applying Kirchoff's laws to the two meshes yields the following
equations:

\[\left \{\begin{array}{rl}
C\frac{d}{dt}{V} = \frac{5 - V}{R_{fast}(V)} + \frac{5 - V}{R_s} - \frac{V}{100 k{Omega} - \frac{V - V_b}{R_{sl}} - I_C(V,V_b)\C_{sl}{frac{d}{dt}{V_b} = \frac{V - V_b}{R_{sl}} - I_B(V,V_b)\.
\end{array}{right}.

a long capacitor charge time \(C_{sl} characterizes the
slow response of the self-exciting model; the current
\(\frac{(5 - V)}{R_s}\) plays a similar role to the source term
\(s(t)\) that appears in the F-N model, that is, it represents the
ionic current of sodium and calcium entering the cell membranes that
excite the system. The choice of \(R_s\) fixes the period between two
excitatory pulsations.

\(I_B\) and \(I_C\) are the base and collector currents of the transistor,
their expressions are given by the Ebers-Moll model:

\[I_C(u,v) = -\frac{I_0}{\beta_r}[e^{200(\frac{V}{5} - \frac{V_b}{5})} - 1] + I_0[e^{200(\frac{V}{5} - e^{200(\frac{V}{5}-\frac{V_b}{5})})}] \]
\[I_B(u,v) = \frac{I_0}{\beta_f}[e^{200(\frac{V}{5})} - 1] + \frac{I_0}{\beta_r}[e^{200(\frac{V}{5}-\frac{V_b}{5})} - 1] \]

The equations of the two meshes can be expressed in the form of the
F-N. equations by normalizing the variables with respect to the voltage of
polarization of the transistors, i.e., 5\(V\).

\[\left \{ \begin{array}{rl}
C\frac{d}{dt}{u} = (1 - u)g_{fast}(u) + (1 - u)\frac{R_f}{R_s} - u\frac{R_f}{100 k\Omega} - (u - v)\frac{R_f}{R_{sl}} - \frac{R_f}{5}I_C(u,v)\C_{sl}\frac{d}{dt}{v} = \epsilon [u - v - \frac{R_f}{R_{sl}}I_B(u,v)]\\\\
\end{array}{right.\]

where \(g_{fast}(u)\) is the ratio \(\frac{R_{fast}(u)}{R_{f}) ;
\(\epsilon\) is the parameter that governs the slow response of the variable
u, and is given by the ratio of the charge times of the two capacitors
\(\frac{R_fC}{R_{sl} C_{sl}}\).

\hypertarget{choice-of-parameters-for-the-model-to-three-transistors}{%
\subsection{choice-of-parameters-for-the-three-transistor-model}
transistor}\label{choice-of-parameters-for-the-model-to-three-transistors}}

In order for our system of differential equations to describe a
fast response solution and a slow response solution, it is necessary to set the
values of the capacitances and resistances such that the time of
charge of the capacitor \(C\) is faster than the discharge time of the
capacitor \(C_{sl}). In particular, \(\epsilon\) which is the ratio
between these two quantities, analagoment to the case of F-N., is set at
a value of 0.01. Thus, we choose the following values for the
capacitances and resistances: \(C = 0.33 \mu f\), \(C_{sl} = 1 \mu f\),
\(R_f = 1k\Omega\), \(R_{sl} = 33 k\Omega\).

To have an excitation period that is long enough and that is
of the order of magnitude of the excitation period of the senotrial node,
the value of \(R_s\) must be set between {[}10 k\(\Omega\) ; 1
M\(\Omega\){]}, so \(R_s\) is set at 330 k\(\Omega\).

The characteristic parameters of the base and emitter currents of the
transistor, obviously depend on the type of transistor used. For
the study of this circuit a 2N3904 was used, to which are
associated with the following parameters:  
 \[ I_0 = 6.7 \cdot 10^{-15} A;\]
 \[\beta_r = 0.737\] 
 \[\beta_f = 416 \]

It remains only to find an expression of the function \(g_{fast}(u)\);
When V increases from zero and passes through a certain threshold value,the
turn on the two transistors, allowing current to flow
through the series combination of Rf and the pnp transistor. This
current acts as a positive feedback trigger that rapidly charges the
capacitor. Therefore \(R_{fast}(V)\) must have a steep transition
until it reaches the value Rf. Based on these considerations, the
ratio \(\frac{R_{fast}}{Rf} = g_{fast}\) can be expressed with
this function:

\[ g_{fast}(u) = \frac{1}{[1 + e^{w_1(V_{t1} -5u)}] \cdot [1 + (\frac{V_{t2}}{5u})^{w_2}]} \]

From the experimental data, a best fit can be obtained and the
parameters present within \(g_{fast}(u)\), this procedure was
been carried out in the article by Jarrett L. Lancaster and Edward H.
Hellenb, obtaining the following values:
\[w_1 = 30; w_2 = 3.5; V_{t1} = 0.48 ; V_{t2} = 1.25 \]
The trend of \(g_{fast}(u)\) in a scale-semilogarithmic scale follows:

   

    \begin{center}
    \adjustimage{max size={0.6\linewidth}{0.6\paperheight}}{TT1.jpg}
    \end{center}
    { \hspace*{\fill} \\}
    
    From the graph, we note that \(g_{fast}(u)\) grows rapidly until it
reach the asymptotic value 1.

The modus operandi of this algorithm is the same as in the first section:
after rewriting the mesh equations in the form of those
of F-N, an algorithm of
Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg for coupled equations up to sixth order. After
such an implementation, plots of \(u\) vs \(v\), \(v\) vs.
\(t\) and \(u\) vs \(t\).

Similarly to what we did with the circuit model of F-N.
we want to verify the Ljapunov-like stability of the three
tranistor. The equations of the trajectories associated with $ \frac{du}{dt} =
0 $ and $ \frac{dv}{dt} =0 $ turn out to be:

\[\left \{ \begin{array}{rl}
(1 - u)g_{fast}(u) + (1 - u)\frac{R_f}{R_s} - u\frac{R_f}{100 k{Omega} - (u - v)\frac{R_f}{R_{sl}} - \frac{R_f}{5}I_C(u,v) = 0\u - v - \frac{R_f}{R_{sl}}I_B(u,v) = 0\.
\end{array}{right}.


The solution of the system can be derived by applying the method of
bisection to the two trajectories. Having chosen the initial point vi and final point vf
of the domain on which to search for zero and \(\epsilon1\)\(\epsilon2\)
arbitrarily small quantities,the algorithm proceeds as follows: for a
given value of u and chosen the interval over which to search for zero
{[}vi,vf{]}:
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.
\tightlist
\item
   We calculate $vn = \frac{v_i + v_f} {2}$;
\item
 One calculates $f(u,vn)$
\item
If $(f(u,vn)$ \textless{} e_1$ \quad and \quad $|v_f - v_i\textbar{} \textless{} e_2$ \quad the cycle stops: \(vn\) is
the approximate one-zero value of the function. If vn does not meet
that condition then:
\item
the algorithm calculates \ f(u,vn)\.
\cdot \ f(u,vi)\).
\item
 If \ f(u,vn)\ \ \cdot \ \ f(u,vi)\
\textgreater{} 0, \(vn\) is substituted for \(vi\) and returns to Step 1,
otherwise substitutes \(vn\) for \(vf\) and returns to Step 1.

\end{enumerate}

the algorithm was repeated a number of i times as the
variable u.

    The point obtained from the intersection has coordinates (0.16,0.17)
corresponding to the initial condition that we assigned in the
search for the solutions of the model. If we repeat the RKF algorithm
by varying the initial condition we have that:

    The equilibrium point of the three-transistor model turns out to be stable,
in fact chosen an initial condition other than stability,
we have that the new trajectory given, retraces the same points as the
trajectory given by the equilibrium condition. Regardless of the
initial condition the trajectories of the system tend to the same
curve.

The self-excitatory systems we have previously described are
analogous to the sinoatrial node, the heart's natural pacemaker, located
in the upper part of the right atrium. The source terms \(s(t)\) and
\((1-u)Rf/Rs\) in the equations of the two models correspond to the
calcium currents flowing in the sinoatrial node cells.
These currents are responsible for the increase in the
membrane, generating the pacemaker pulse. The pulse signal
heartbeat generated by the sinoatrial node propagates through the cells
muscles of the atria, causing them to contract and send blood
into the ventricles. At the same time, the signal travels through the
cell membranes of the cardiac conduction system until it reaches
to the atrioventricular node, located between the right atrium and the ventricle.
